# MSetArithmetic
An implementation of N. J. Wildberger's model of arithmetic using multisets
The basic unit is the multiset. A multiset is an unordered collection of objects with the allowance for repeated instances.
The number zero is represented by the empty mset []. An integer is represented by an mset containing msets. Thus 1 is [[]]
2 is [[][]] and so on.
